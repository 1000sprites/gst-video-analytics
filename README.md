# GStreamer Video Analytics Plugins
This is preview of the product functionality that is being introduced to gain early developer feedback. Comments, questions, and suggestions are encouraged and should be submitted to [the GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/opencv/gst-video-analytics/issues)

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of GStreamer elements to enable CNN model based video analytics capabilities (such as object detection, classification, recognition) in GStreamer framework.
The complete solution leverages
* Open source GStreamer framework for pipeline management
* GStreamer plugins for input and output such as media files and real-time streaming from camera or network
* Video decode and encode plugins, either CPU optimized plugins or GPU-accelerated plugins [based on VAAPI](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer-vaapi)

and additionally installs the following Deep Learning specific elements from this repository
* Inference plugins leveraging [Intel OpenVINO](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) for high performance inference using CNN models
* Visualization of computer vision results (such as bounding boxes and labels of detected objects) on top of video stream

## License
GStreamer Video Analytics Plugins are licensed under [MIT license](LICENSE).

## Prerequisites
### Hardware
* Refer to OpenVINO SDK for [hardware requirements for inference elements](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit/hardware);
* On platforms with Intel Gen graphics, refer to gstreamer-vaapi for [HW accelerated video decode and encode requirements](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer-vaapi).
### Software
* Linux* system with kernel >= 4.15
* GStreamer framework >= 1.14

## Build and Run
[This link](https://github.com/opencv/gst-video-analytics/wiki/Build-and-Run) provides detailed instructions how to build plugins and run samples in [docker container](https://github.com/opencv/gst-video-analytics/wiki/Acquire-docker-image-and-run-docker-container) or [directly on host machine](https://github.com/opencv/gst-video-analytics/wiki/Build-on-host-machine).
